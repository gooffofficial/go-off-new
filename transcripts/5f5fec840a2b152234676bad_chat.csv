5f751e714108db9f7c247f54,44,JGriesbach, Hi ,2020-10-01 00:10:25.392000
5f751e914108db1cf2247f55,47,JZheng,hi Jali!,2020-10-01 00:10:57.195000
5f751eee4108dbf297247f56,44,JGriesbach,so I would agree that the debate was an absolute mess ,2020-10-01 00:12:30.701000
5f751f224108db202c247f57,46,GRobinson,Yes totally,2020-10-01 00:13:22.373000
5f751f374108db0983247f58,46,GRobinson,"as a moderate, I felt totally alienated by both candidates ",2020-10-01 00:13:43.362000
5f751f444108db20b3247f59,44,JGriesbach,I dont think there was any clear winner ,2020-10-01 00:13:56.232000
5f751f524108db53d0247f5a,44,JGriesbach,I just think Biden acted like a grown up and more presidential than Trump ,2020-10-01 00:14:10.196000
5f751f624108db1363247f5b,47,JZheng,Do you think each candidate's debate style and tactic worked for them? ,2020-10-01 00:14:26.141000
5f751f794108dbc1b5247f5c,46,GRobinson,yeah I think Biden came out on top in terms of appearances and television presence ,2020-10-01 00:14:49.568000
5f751f7f4108dbdea9247f5d,44,JGriesbach,I'm not sure Trump had a debate style besides self-imploding from the start ,2020-10-01 00:14:55.793000
5f751f964108db82b3247f5e,44,JGriesbach,Biden looking directly into the camera was really effective I think ,2020-10-01 00:15:18.352000
5f751fad4108db4201247f5f,46,GRobinson,"yeah, Trumps aggression was not what he needed to use tonight. It has helped him in the past but totally not the vibe for this debate",2020-10-01 00:15:41.614000
5f751fb64108db2504247f60,46,GRobinson,oh I totally agree about Biden though ,2020-10-01 00:15:50.263000
5f751fd44108db4392247f61,46,GRobinson,very Reagan-esque presence on camera that helped boost my confidence in him as a candidate ,2020-10-01 00:16:20.262000
5f751fec4108db30dd247f62,44,JGriesbach,Yeah definitely. It was nice to see him have a solid presence like that ,2020-10-01 00:16:44.337000
5f751fec4108db4207247f63,47,JZheng,What was the most memorable thing from the debate for you guys?,2020-10-01 00:16:44.493000
5f751fee4108db8bf6247f64,44,JGriesbach,What did you think about Chris wallace as the moderator? Do you think he should have done something differently?,2020-10-01 00:16:46.442000
5f75200b4108dbd09c247f65,47,JZheng,I'm conflicted about Chris Wallace actually,2020-10-01 00:17:15.315000
5f7520184108db5dea247f66,47,JZheng,did you guys know that he's actually a registered dem?,2020-10-01 00:17:28.548000
5f75201d4108db74d0247f67,47,JZheng,crazy,2020-10-01 00:17:33.434000
5f75203b4108db2506247f68,47,JZheng,i think not really Chris Wallace's fault on this but the debate tech team should have just cut Trump's mic at some point,2020-10-01 00:18:03.141000
5f7520424108dbcc15247f69,47,JZheng,and Biden's,2020-10-01 00:18:10.534000
5f75205c4108db3235247f6a,47,JZheng,what do you guys think?,2020-10-01 00:18:36.482000
5f75208f4108db789a247f6b,46,GRobinson,"Yeah, in the end the voters suffered because we could even hear what they were trying to say when they talked over eachother ",2020-10-01 00:19:27.876000
5f7520a34108db349f247f6c,46,GRobinson,"Im not sure cutting the mic is the solution, but something needed to be worked out ",2020-10-01 00:19:47.686000
5f7520b64108db998f247f6d,78,cdehaven,hi,2020-10-01 00:20:06.320000

5f7520cb4108dbe3eb247f71,78,cdehaven,i was having tech issues lol,2020-10-01 00:20:27.141000

5f7520fa4108dbef82247f73,78,cdehaven,I think that both men were enable to have a conversation about anything ,2020-10-01 00:21:14.623000
5f75210b4108db6216247f74,78,cdehaven,Because they are so stuck about being against each other ,2020-10-01 00:21:31.199000
5f75210f4108db98c1247f75,44,JGriesbach,I wonder if a town hall style debate next time will be better or worse ,2020-10-01 00:21:35.949000
5f75211c4108dbe4f4247f76,47,JZheng,"and Madeleine, yeah I agree cutting mic could be a bit aggressive, what do you think could be a better idea?",2020-10-01 00:21:48.010000
5f7521404108db29bc247f77,78,cdehaven,I like town hall ,2020-10-01 00:22:24.693000
5f7521514108db2efa247f78,78,cdehaven,They really can not have a convo on stage together ,2020-10-01 00:22:41.915000
5f75216b4108db0f22247f79,47,JZheng,"me too, I found that Chris Wallace asked good questions but a lot of people on twitter and my friends were saying they wish he had asked other ones too or follow ups",2020-10-01 00:23:07.681000
5f7521884108db5346247f7a,46,GRobinson,yeah ,2020-10-01 00:23:36.073000
5f7521a04108db7afe247f7b,44,JGriesbach,i think his questions were a bit too long and multi-faceted for a 90 min debate,2020-10-01 00:24:00.700000
5f7521a24108dbd24f247f7c,46,GRobinson,overall i thought he was a good moderator but follow ups to manage the candidate's responses would have been ideal ,2020-10-01 00:24:02.311000
5f7521b54108db9f8f247f7d,78,cdehaven,He was so battered around I felt bad ,2020-10-01 00:24:21.869000
5f7521c24108db9901247f7e,78,cdehaven,They need to get punished if they do not respect debate ruled,2020-10-01 00:24:34.700000

5f75225c4108db4299247f81,44,JGriesbach,"coming from a swing state, I think the debate caused a lot of people who were on the fence to decide not to vote at all ",2020-10-01 00:27:08.389000
5f7522634108dbe56e247f82,47,JZheng,Is there a topic you guys wish they would’ve spent more time on?,2020-10-01 00:27:15.569000

5f7522b44108dbe46c247f86,44,JGriesbach,idk if i just didn't hear this part but I feel like they skipped a discussion about the economy ,2020-10-01 00:28:36.461000
5f7522c14108db74ac247f87,46,GRobinson,"yeah as a moderate from a swing state, this dissuaded me from voting for either candidate",2020-10-01 00:28:49.484000
5f7523014108db11b3247f88,46,GRobinson,the economic discussion ran too long ,2020-10-01 00:29:53.928000
5f75230f4108dbfff5247f89,46,GRobinson,took time away from more important topics,2020-10-01 00:30:07.189000
5f75236b4108db2ec8247f8a,44,JGriesbach,I think the economy is what is affecting a lot of people first hand right now and kind of ties into covid ,2020-10-01 00:31:39.850000
5f7523b94108db2f3f247f8b,44,JGriesbach,It was interesting to watch the Fox news and CNN coverage after ,2020-10-01 00:32:57.313000
5f7523c64108db7df8247f8c,44,JGriesbach,everyone seemed to agree it was a mess and I didn't hear many people defending either candidate ,2020-10-01 00:33:10.413000
5f7524954108db137e247f8d,47,JZheng, What would you guys hope to see from future presidential debates?,2020-10-01 00:36:37.007000

5f7525a54108db0e7d247f9d,44,JGriesbach,I think Kamala has good buzz words and moments but when it comes to defending her policies she's not the best (as seen in primaries) ,2020-10-01 00:41:09.015000
5f7525d64108db46b8247f9e,120,wangsteam,she's a bit defensive and could be more open,2020-10-01 00:41:58.540000
5f7525dc4108db9a70247f9f,120,wangsteam,but maybe that's just a style thing,2020-10-01 00:42:04.175000
5f7525f94108db1a55247fa0,46,GRobinson,Kamala has the energy that Biden lacks and Biden makes up for her inability to be thorough ,2020-10-01 00:42:33.877000
