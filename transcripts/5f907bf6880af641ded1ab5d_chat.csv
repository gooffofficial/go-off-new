5f90cb33927d6fee374e4dd5,146,MSalman, Hey there Go Off! Community ,2020-10-21 23:58:43.759000
5f90cb54927d6fdd134e4dd7,44,JGriesbach, hello! looking forward to the chat,2020-10-21 23:59:16.627000
5f90cb94927d6f83b24e4dd8,146,MSalman,to open today's discussion with a basic question - what is your favorite Disney movie and why ,2020-10-22 00:00:20.888000
5f90cc0d927d6f5a694e4dd9,146,MSalman,"As a kid, my favorite was Hercules because I loved the music ",2020-10-22 00:02:21.553000
5f90cc2c927d6f4ec54e4dda,44,JGriesbach,"I actually just watched hercules for the first time this past weekend, and I loved the music! ",2020-10-22 00:02:52.589000
5f90cc2c927d6f615d4e4ddb,44,JGriesbach,,2020-10-22 00:02:52.989000
5f90cc4d927d6fc8844e4ddc,146,MSalman,Yeah the best Disney music! ,2020-10-22 00:03:25.168000
5f90cc62927d6fa2654e4ddd,44,JGriesbach,I'd have to say my favorite Disney movie is probably lilo and stitch or the Monsters Inc movies ,2020-10-22 00:03:46.405000
5f90cc94927d6f76f94e4dde,146,MSalman,yeah those were fun to watch as a kid too ,2020-10-22 00:04:36.262000
5f90ccb6927d6f5e854e4ddf,146,MSalman,"to me, what's most interesting about Disney is the fact that their content is way more than just kids movies we grew up watching ",2020-10-22 00:05:10.563000
5f90cce4927d6f331a4e4de0,44,JGriesbach,"Right! I don't have disney+, but I was looking through my friend's account and forgot how much stuff they own and create",2020-10-22 00:05:56.050000
5f90cd24927d6f79ab4e4de1,146,MSalman,Yeah! right now Disney owns just under 40% of American media and production,2020-10-22 00:07:00.383000
5f90cd91927d6f311c4e4de2,44,JGriesbach," That's crazy, and it sounds like they're going to keep pushing for more of their content to be released on Disney+ right?",2020-10-22 00:08:49.695000
5f90cda7927d6ffbc64e4de3,44,JGriesbach,I wonder how that will impact Netflix or Prime,2020-10-22 00:09:11.749000
5f90cdc3927d6f82444e4de4,146,MSalman,"yeah, that's exactly what the article touches on ",2020-10-22 00:09:39.946000
5f90cde3927d6f8bdd4e4de5,146,MSalman,"Personally, I think they are trying to compete with the internet exclusives on Netflix or prime ",2020-10-22 00:10:11.114000
5f90ce01927d6fc5824e4de6,146,MSalman,Most of Disney's stuff is released on mainstream theaters and television networks ,2020-10-22 00:10:41.632000
5f90ce23927d6fe9054e4de7,146,MSalman,but the market is leaning further and further towards preferring the exclusivity of streaming platform originals ,2020-10-22 00:11:15.558000
5f90ce57927d6f3a344e4de8,44,JGriesbach,"Even before COVID, I think the last movie I saw in theaters was LaLa Land? So yeah, I can see how streaming is really taking over the market",2020-10-22 00:12:07.523000
5f90ce95927d6f537a4e4de9,146,MSalman,theaters were becoming more of a novelty and less a viewing necessity before covid. Now all the content that's been released over the last six months has been online ,2020-10-22 00:13:09.172000
5f90ceb2927d6f749e4e4dea,146,MSalman,and they actually didn't lose as much money as anticipated by doing that ,2020-10-22 00:13:38.480000
5f90ceec927d6f211d4e4deb,44,JGriesbach,interesting. do you know of any media companies that aren't adapting well to the shift toward streaming? ,2020-10-22 00:14:36.566000
5f90cfa8927d6f58914e4dec,146,MSalman,"It's honestly something I didn't consider looking into for this conversation. But it would have been interesting to compare why they fail or survive in the age of ""stream-mageddon"" ",2020-10-22 00:17:44.708000
5f90cfe5927d6f13a84e4ded,146,MSalman,what interested me more is why a media company as Big as Disney would want to put all of their content online ,2020-10-22 00:18:45.972000
5f90d006927d6fa64e4e4dee,44,JGriesbach,"I feel like one of the main reasons they're doing it (besides money) is because it feels like the ""right thing to do"" at this time",2020-10-22 00:19:18.256000
5f90d02a927d6f0a224e4def,44,JGriesbach,"every company, not just media ones, are really pushing for that online presence, and it seems like Disney fears being unrelatable or disconnected from that audience",2020-10-22 00:19:54.257000
5f90d062927d6f539b4e4df0,146,MSalman,"That's very true, in the past Disney has failed to keep up with media trends and at one point was a very conservative company ",2020-10-22 00:20:50.563000
5f90d087927d6f21b54e4df1,146,MSalman,so I think a huge part of this is a bid for a positive public opinion ,2020-10-22 00:21:27.187000
5f90d097927d6fc46e4e4df2,146,MSalman,as a way to hold peoples interest ,2020-10-22 00:21:43.240000
5f90d0a6927d6f19344e4df3,146,MSalman,because of the endless options for streaming and media online,2020-10-22 00:21:58.347000
5f90d0e4927d6f75cc4e4df4,146,MSalman,"I just watched a 40 minute video of the try guys eating everything at Jack in the Box. They aren't in the same league as Disney, but Disney knows they are competing with thousands of versions of the try guys for our attention ",2020-10-22 00:23:00.296000
5f90d0f7927d6f1bc14e4df5,146,MSalman,it makes sense to take their media where our attention already is. ,2020-10-22 00:23:19.001000
5f90d113927d6f071d4e4df6,44,JGriesbach,yeah that's a really good point. do you think the actual content itself will shift more too? like to fit shorter form youtube content or short tv series?,2020-10-22 00:23:47.441000
5f90d159927d6fc4924e4df7,146,MSalman,"I think they will always put out high quality content, like the Mandalorian or Toy Story. But it wouldn't surprise me if they also started a short form or low budget arm of production specifically for youtube audiences ",2020-10-22 00:24:57.514000
5f90d16a927d6fcd0c4e4df8,146,MSalman,nickelodeon did it with Awesomeness TV and they have been very successful ,2020-10-22 00:25:14.216000
5f90d24b927d6f74524e4df9,44,JGriesbach,"not only does Disney have to keep up with the trends, but I forget that much of their revenue also comes from theme parks and cruise ships, which have all been shut down",2020-10-22 00:28:59.046000
5f90d288927d6fe8ce4e4dfa,146,MSalman,Yeah another reason for this dramatic restructuring could be to recoup some of the losses from their theme park and vacation,2020-10-22 00:30:00.666000
5f90d28d927d6fbcac4e4dfb,146,MSalman,arms ,2020-10-22 00:30:05.368000
5f90d2b9927d6f448d4e4dfc,44,JGriesbach, I think they were trying to make up for some loss of audience in recent years with all of the live-action remakes of classic films ,2020-10-22 00:30:49.091000
5f90d2bd927d6f88234e4dfd,151,ahsieh22, Hi. I'm Ashley I am here,2020-10-22 00:30:53.877000
5f90d2cd927d6f1c1f4e4dfe,146,MSalman,the current model wasn't exactly covid proof ,2020-10-22 00:31:09.200000
5f90d2d5927d6f4f154e4dff,146,MSalman,hey Ashley! welcome to the convo ,2020-10-22 00:31:17.846000
5f90d2df927d6f55364e4e00,44,JGriesbach,Hi Ashley! ,2020-10-22 00:31:27.219000
5f90d2f9927d6f21d14e4e01,146,MSalman,So I want to continue the convo by asking ,2020-10-22 00:31:53.644000
5f90d330927d6f39c74e4e02,146,MSalman,do you think that Disney's streaming forward restructuring is viable in the long term ,2020-10-22 00:32:48.034000
5f90d35d927d6ff9424e4e03,151,ahsieh22,"I honestly think it is considering how popular Netflix, YouTube premium and other channels are ",2020-10-22 00:33:33.144000
5f90d3a4927d6f18884e4e04,146,MSalman,Thats very true ,2020-10-22 00:34:44.231000
5f90d3c1927d6f7b214e4e05,44,JGriesbach,"I think it will come down to almost a competition like CBS, ABC, and NBC have but with Netflix and Disney+ and maybe Prime or Youtube?",2020-10-22 00:35:13.015000
5f90d3d5927d6f06cf4e4e06,44,JGriesbach,"I'm not sure if it's viable long term, but for now, the streaming is definitely helping them out",2020-10-22 00:35:33.282000
5f90d3ec927d6f62df4e4e07,151,ahsieh22,I know a lot of college kids are really into Disney+ even though most of the movies aren't technically made for our age group,2020-10-22 00:35:56.701000
5f90d3f1927d6f18614e4e08,146,MSalman,"I agree, it works well now. Their most recognizable and most popular properties are the blockbuster movies that they release in theaters ",2020-10-22 00:36:01.330000
5f90d3fc927d6ff97c4e4e09,146,MSalman,and the mulan release they did only on Disney plus flopped majorly ,2020-10-22 00:36:12.779000
5f90d41b927d6f31404e4e0a,146,MSalman,I think they should be smarter about it than by putting all of their content online ,2020-10-22 00:36:43.195000
5f90d41f927d6f7b8a4e4e0b,151,ahsieh22,I think Disney movies really hold a special place in everyone's heart and I think now with COVID-19 people want to be sentimental,2020-10-22 00:36:47.900000
5f90d46a927d6f2f304e4e0c,146,MSalman,thats a really good point. A lot of people got Disney plus over the quarantine to rewatch their favorite movies ,2020-10-22 00:38:02.501000
5f90d481927d6f1a404e4e0d,146,MSalman,But will this model work for new content as well? ,2020-10-22 00:38:25.251000
5f90d488927d6f7d3e4e4e0e,146,MSalman,"and for content that isnt animated, like sports ",2020-10-22 00:38:32.935000
5f90d4e2927d6f56b14e4e0f,151,ahsieh22,I think we are entering a new stage in our lives where the newest consumer doesn't always stay in one place and is on the move ,2020-10-22 00:40:02.546000
5f90d4e3927d6f4e2d4e4e10,151,ahsieh22,so yes ,2020-10-22 00:40:03.738000
5f90d4ec927d6f3ee54e4e11,44,JGriesbach,"that's a great question. I think that even though Disney can put out good content on streaming services, it's hard to replace the experience of going to see a movie or watching a sports game on live tv ",2020-10-22 00:40:12.117000
5f90d538927d6f9c9f4e4e12,146,MSalman,"They have a controlling stake in Hulu and they own ESPN which have live sports. But putting it online completely changes how people experience the content, to begin with. ",2020-10-22 00:41:28.685000
5f90d5ba927d6fd7914e4e13,44,JGriesbach,yeah absolutely,2020-10-22 00:43:38.675000
5f90d5bb927d6f73364e4e14,44,JGriesbach,,2020-10-22 00:43:39.787000
5f90d5d9927d6f4f5e4e4e15,44,JGriesbach,it will be interesting to see how media companies try to emulate that movie-going experience with streaming services,2020-10-22 00:44:09.463000
5f90d623927d6fe5864e4e16,146,MSalman,I think there will be a shift to a more community-oriented experience  ,2020-10-22 00:45:23.939000
5f90d639927d6f2bea4e4e17,146,MSalman,like a way to engage audiences while they stream ,2020-10-22 00:45:45.051000
5f90d647927d6f2b044e4e18,146,MSalman,make them feel like the are out watching a movie ,2020-10-22 00:45:59.420000
5f90d681927d6ff5974e4e19,44,JGriesbach,yeah I think whatever company does the best at that will have the most longevity in streaming ,2020-10-22 00:46:57.678000
5f90d6c9927d6f88174e4e1a,146,MSalman,its a bit like a contest ,2020-10-22 00:48:09.261000
5f90d6e0927d6f4b094e4e1b,146,MSalman,and its interesting to see how each of them interpret what they think audiences want ,2020-10-22 00:48:32.557000
5f90d71a927d6f509f4e4e1c,151,ahsieh22,I think people during these times really want to feel connected to others ,2020-10-22 00:49:30.326000
5f90d760927d6fa4cc4e4e1d,44,JGriesbach,yeah Netflix parties does a good job at encouraging that ,2020-10-22 00:50:40.181000
5f90d778927d6f002d4e4e1e,44,JGriesbach,"but i also just realized it wasn't started by Netflix, so maybe it will be up to individual companies to foster that connection ",2020-10-22 00:51:04.946000
5f90d787927d6f304e4e4e1f,146,MSalman,Netflix was my go-to for connecting with people during quaramtine ,2020-10-22 00:51:19.506000
5f90d790927d6f12ab4e4e20,146,MSalman,which was a huge win for them ,2020-10-22 00:51:28.385000
5f90d7af927d6f80654e4e21,146,MSalman,because that was the experience many audiences had,2020-10-22 00:51:59.231000
5f90d81d927d6fdfb14e4e22,146,MSalman,we are coming up on the end of our convo ,2020-10-22 00:53:49.910000
5f90d839927d6fe9134e4e23,146,MSalman,to wrap what does everyone see the future of movie-going to be? ,2020-10-22 00:54:17.221000
5f90d89e927d6ff8b44e4e24,44,JGriesbach,"I'm selfishly hoping that after these next couple of years of people continuing to stream and stay in more, there will be a boom in theaters and movie-going! ",2020-10-22 00:55:58.796000
5f90d8b8927d6f95914e4e25,146,MSalman,will theaters ever come back? or will streaming take over? ,2020-10-22 00:56:24.628000
5f90d93d927d6fb59e4e4e26,152,bionkers, I'm not sure if theaters will come back in the same form that they existed pre-COVID 19. ,2020-10-22 00:58:37.820000
5f90d960927d6fb5154e4e27,146,MSalman,will theaters come back ? or will we stream everything? ,2020-10-22 00:59:12.647000
5f90d992927d6f51e54e4e28,44,JGriesbach,"I like to think that there will be a wave of more theater-going when people want to reminisce and go back to the ""good old days"" of watching movies hahaha",2020-10-22 01:00:02.829000
5f90d9eb927d6f62e04e4e29,152,bionkers,"I think people are pretty stubborn, so the tradition will persist. Unless, of course, the pandemic goes on longer than any of us would like it to! ",2020-10-22 01:01:31.698000
5f90d9ed927d6fe3c84e4e2a,146,MSalman,okay well this is about the end of our convo! have a great night everybody ,2020-10-22 01:01:33.940000
5f90d9f7927d6f01ee4e4e2b,152,bionkers,good night! ,2020-10-22 01:01:43.479000
5f90da04927d6f492a4e4e2c,44,JGriesbach,thank you for hosting and thanks everyone it was nice chatting with you! ,2020-10-22 01:01:56.738000
