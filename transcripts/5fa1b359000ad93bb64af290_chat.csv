5fa1dd2e20bb2508e1da8ab3,172,Anaoberg,"McGrath is moderate, Booker is progressive",2020-11-03 22:43:58.988000
5fa1dd3d20bb256bd2da8ab4,143,leachs22,Ah fair ,2020-11-03 22:44:13.323000
5fa1dd5020bb25df53da8ab5,143,leachs22,Seems like a trend where the dems are prioritizing moderates over progressives,2020-11-03 22:44:32.100000
5fa1dd6420bb25378ada8ab6,173,splaaarfnclaaarf,"general public prob is less inclined to vote for progressives, at least older people it seems",2020-11-03 22:44:52.749000
5fa1dd6520bb255179da8ab7,143,leachs22,Idk if its because they don't agree with progressives ideals or if they just think that moderates will be more successful politically,2020-11-03 22:44:53.457000
5fa1dd9920bb254f18da8ab8,172,Anaoberg,"I think republicans are just getting really vulnerable, and democrats don't want to lose the opportunity to replace them by running progressive candidates",2020-11-03 22:45:45.404000
5fa1dda520bb255ed6da8ab9,172,Anaoberg,but progressive issues are popular! Democrats just overthink,2020-11-03 22:45:57.326000
5fa1ddae20bb25062dda8aba,172,Anaoberg,and then we end up with candidates we don't like,2020-11-03 22:46:06.258000
5fa1ddb620bb253054da8abb,171,kels_sarracino,yeah but it's more about getting the unsure people to pick them ,2020-11-03 22:46:14.605000
5fa1ddb720bb257c07da8abc,143,leachs22,Thats fair but I mean the same thing happened with bernie last time and we saw how that turned out,2020-11-03 22:46:15.530000
5fa1ddc520bb25b89eda8abd,171,kels_sarracino,democratic will likely vote democratic just based on the fact that they're democrats,2020-11-03 22:46:29.100000
5fa1ddcf20bb2547cada8abe,143,leachs22,Agreed same w republicans,2020-11-03 22:46:39.867000
5fa1ddda20bb258279da8abf,171,kels_sarracino,the moderates are the ones who have the highest chance of appealing to the progressive republicans or people on the fence,2020-11-03 22:46:50.163000
5fa1dddf20bb25abbbda8ac0,143,leachs22,The deepening of party lines is super sad,2020-11-03 22:46:55.746000
5fa1dde920bb256589da8ac1,143,leachs22,That's super true,2020-11-03 22:47:05.136000
5fa1de0620bb25c00bda8ac2,143,leachs22,"Just kinda sucks, as a liberal, to see those values sort of getting put on the wayside to appeal to the moderates",2020-11-03 22:47:34.567000
5fa1de1320bb2547a9da8ac3,172,Anaoberg,"I don't think that democrats should be appealing to conservatives. I think we should build up our party. Instead, democrats alienate progressives with the hopes of getting the votes of a few moderates",2020-11-03 22:47:47.411000
5fa1de2920bb25b90dda8ac4,173,splaaarfnclaaarf,"agree w Kelsey, for centrists or those unsure they dont want something ""too far off"" so a centrist democrat is what they want",2020-11-03 22:48:09.054000
5fa1de3c20bb2515f6da8ac5,171,kels_sarracino,but you can't persuade people to make such drastic changes ,2020-11-03 22:48:28.306000

5fa1de4120bb25f323da8ac7,143,leachs22,I know a lot of people who don't like biden because of how moderate he is and I'm honestly with them,2020-11-03 22:48:33.967000
5fa1de4520bb2502d1da8ac8,171,kels_sarracino,you have to change behavior first and that's done incredibly slowly ,2020-11-03 22:48:37.932000
5fa1de4b20bb253560da8ac9,143,leachs22,Thats very fair,2020-11-03 22:48:43.108000

5fa1dedc20bb25c340da8ad2,143,leachs22,I think a lot of us have forgotten that PT a lot of people just didn't really pay attention to politics which left much more wiggle room for politicians to not fulfill promises ,2020-11-03 22:51:08.386000
