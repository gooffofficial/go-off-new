Miley Cyrus lived the best of both worlds as Hannah Montana for six years when the teen sitcom ran on Disney Channel, and 15 years later, she's saying thank you to her alter ego.The 28-year-old pop superstar penned a handwritten letter on Wednesday's (March 24) 15th anniversary of Hannah Montana, which is currently streaming on Disney+, recalling the show's very first and last episodes and cherishing all the memories that happened in between, on a star-adorned sheet of pink paper with a sparkly purple border that hearkened back to the show's aesthetic.""Hi Hannah, It's been a while. 15 years to be exact. Since the first time I slid those blonde bangs over my forehead in the best attempt to conceal my identity. Then slipped into a puke pink terry cloth robe with a bedazzled HM over the [heart],"" Cyrus writes, describing the first scene of the pilot episode, which aired on Disney Channel on March 24, 2006. ""I didn't know then ... that is where you would live forever. Not just in mine but millions of people around the world.""Hannah MontanaMiley CyrusThe show opened to the highest ratings in the channel’s history, with 5.4 million viewers. Despite the show's premise of a Malibu teenager named Miley Stewart living a double life as a student by day and pop star by night, Cyrus wrote that Hannah served as more than her alter-ego, and she once even considered her to hold ""more of my identity in your glovette than I did in my bare hands. We had an equal exchange in which you provided a superlative amount of fame in return for the anonymity I could gift to you.""She ends the letter by recalling the very last episode of Hannah Montana (the fourth and final season was specifically dubbed Hannah Montana Forever), which was named after the song she sang during the Jan. 16, 2011-dated episode ""Wherever I Go.""""The final episode was appropriately titled 'Wherever I Go' after a song by the teen pop sensation herself. YOU. Me? Hannah Montana,"" the letter continues on its second page. ""The first verse sings 'Everything is about to change. A chapter ending but the stories only just begun. A page is turning for everyone.' And closes on a soaring chorus belting 'We might be apart but I hope you always know you'll be with me wherever I go.' Hannah, I hope you hear me + believe those words are true. You have all my love + upmost gratitude. Breathing life into you for those 6 years was an honor.""And sweet niblets, Hannah sure heard her. The official Twitter account for the fictional-but-oh-so-real pop star shot back a sarcastic reply to Cyrus: ""Nice to hear from you @MileyCyrus. It's only been a decade.""Hannah Montana has 20 Billboard Hot 100 songs to her own name, including the top 10 hit ""He Could Be the One."" She also scored three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 -- Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana 2 / Meet Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana: The Movie. And her 2007 Best of Both Worlds Tour earned Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus the breakthrough artist award at the 2008 Billboard Touring Awards, beating out the Jonas Brothers and Michael Bublé.Steve Vincent, Disney Channel’s vp of music and soundtracks, reflected to Billboard in an oral history of the show's musical impact that Cyrus herself had successfully become ""one of the biggest pop stars in the world"" apart from the one she was playing on TV by the time the series had ended a decade ago. ""She had, in some ways, made it come true, from the fictional pop star to the real pop star,"" he said.But Cyrus didn't just send Hannah something sweet for the show's 15th anniversary: She also sent Joe Jonas -- who, along with the Jonas Brothers, guest-starred on an episode and performed ""We Got the Party"" with her -- a purple, pink and yellow floral arrangement in the shape of a star, Hannah's signature motif, and a note that read, ""It was so sweet of you to name your daughter after me! Sending all my love to little Miss Hannah Montana!""""HOLY HANNAH MONTANA!!! THANK YOU @mileycyrus WE LOVE IT! THIS IS EPIC!! Jonas wrote via his Instagram Story on Wednesday while playing the theme song ""The Best of Both Worlds.""Read Cyrus' sweet letter -- and Hannah's reply -- below.A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry© 2021 Billboard Media, LLC.

https://www.bu.edu/articles/2021/bu-administrators-add-two-wellness-days-to-this-semesters-calendar/,"2 February, 2021 at 8:21 AMVisit Back2BU for the latest updates and information on BU's response to COVID-19. Students can find additional information in the Undergraduate Student Guide and Graduate & Professional Student Guide.While vegging out and staying off Zoom are two viable options for the upcoming wellness days, the BU Wellbeing Project is planning in-person activities to encourage casual social interactions as well as self-directed wellness activities.

Photo by Janice ChecchioAdd spring break to the growing list of things that have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The weeklong March vacation was canceled with the aim of reducing the University community’s risk of COVID-19 exposure. Administrators had worried that having students, faculty, and staff travel could lead to a surge of cases on campus.But going through the semester without a chance to rest and recharge wasn’t a viable solution, either. In a letter sent on January 13 to students and faculty, Jean Morrison, University provost and chief academic officer, announced that BU has added two wellness days to the spring academic calendar. No classes, no exams, and no homework on those days. In other words, everyone should take the time for a mental health break.The two wellness days are scheduled for Thursday, March 18, 2021, and Wednesday, March 31, 2021, planned to align with the Presidents Day and Patriots Day holidays, so there is a break in the academic calendar every four to six weeks throughout the semester. Sue Kennedy, interim associate provost for undergraduate affairs, whose team helped to coordinate the days, says that breaks from the intensity of the semester are important. “We thought that given what a unique situation this academic year is,” she says, “it is important that students and faculty have periods of respite.” BU is not alone in instituting wellness days. Harvard, Penn State, and Duke are among other Universities that have decided to add wellness days to their spring calendar as well. Back in November, Student Government’s Mental Health Committee (MHC) proposed the idea for four wellness days. Kennedy says the BU administration considered the request and that Kenneth Elmore (Wheelock’87), associate provost and dean of students, was in contact with student leaders to coordinate a plan.Morrison’s letter also stated that graduate schools and clinical programs with their own calendars (the School of Law, the School of Social Work, and the Medical Campus schools) have the option of choosing two different days that work better for their calendars. The wellness days do not apply to online-only courses that run for seven weeks. “I understand that this calendar adjustment will require some faculty to adjust syllabi and potentially remove some planned content from their courses,” Morrison wrote, before asking for faculty to refrain from adding on work as a makeup. “I hope that we can all embrace these Wellness Days as opportunities to recharge.”Evan Teplensky (CAS’23), a College of Arts & Sciences Student Government senator, was involved with the planning and echoes that hope, saying that he worries that professors will still quietly assign work and tests for the day following a wellness day, forcing students to use their time off as study time. There have been reports about this on the BU Reddit page. Teplensky urges students to report these instances to their department chair or dean if they find this happening. “It’s important that we really get these days off, these days away from Zoom,” he says.MHC cochair Savannah Majarwitz (CAS’22) cites a School of Public Health study last September that found that the pandemic has caused the depression rate to triple among US adults, and that even students and faculty who haven’t been diagnosed with depression still need a much-deserved mental health break.While vegging out and staying off Zoom are two viable options for these days, the BU Wellbeing Project is planning in-person activities to encourage casual social interactions, as well as self-directed wellness activities. BU Today will provide more details on these events in March. “We hope that people take the day, go for a walk on the Esplanade, explore Boston safely, and still remember to mask and social distance,” Kennedy says. “Unplug for the day.”BU Administrators Add Two Wellness Days to This Semester’s Calendar

							Profile						
Boston University moderates comments to facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation. Abusive, profane, self-promotional, misleading, incoherent or off-topic comments will be rejected. Moderators are staffed during regular business hours (EST) and can only accept comments written in English.Faculty and staff – myself included – joined the fray early in asking our administrators to offer our exhausted and stressed out students opportunities to take care of themselves and take time off. This was something our students asked for as soon as the cancellation of the spring break was announced, and my colleagues and I urged our administrators to heed that, since we’ve seen so much student burn-out (to say nothing of our own) over the last year.Thankfully, BU’s administrators took decisive and courageous action, showing their characteristically strong leadership. To wit, they announced these “Wellness Days” (great HR language, by the way) days before the semester was due to begin, adding yet another wrench into our own syllabi and course plans after we had sacrificed yet another break to retool them for this godawful LfA model. We’re happy that students get time to pause (though doubt any of them will really be able to), yet feel exhausted and continually disrespected by our administrators who send us back in the classroom without the slightest words of appreciation for the mountains we’ve been moving. (Not even going to get started on our pay freeze or the end of our retirement contributions.) President Brown’s one message of encouragement was to thank us for publicizing BU to local media outlets – sure, you’re welcome, I guess?Tone-deaf and late to the party, as always – the bottom heap of Boston universities in terms of leadership, tone, class, and respect for the community.But not for staff? Ouch.Pretty sure it would be better to just give the students spring break. There’s no way BU is following the science on this decision, rather they are just making decisions that look good, but in fact hurt the students and creates a separation between the students and administrators.So if my teacher is forcing us to attend a second session of class to make up for missing that day, can I report this incident? Because I think it’s unfair as I work and would have to take time off just because of the wellness day. This wellness day will force teachers to pile on more work or force students to attend extra sessions on their free time to make up for it. How do I go about reporting this?I am concerned about this rush to “report” faculty, this is all very confusing to the entire community and this attempt to go to the boss is representative of the erosion of faculty/student relationships. The faculty I work with are empathetic, concerned and want to support students while we all struggle with our own mental health. If some faculty are intentionally ignoring the spirit of these schedule changes that is one thing, but I am troubled that we assume bad faith.Except all those colleges you listed (Harvard, Penn State, Duke) are giving their students more than TWO “Wellness Days.” If BU’s highest priority was student health and “wellness”, the administration would listen to what students have been telling them for the past year: https://dailyfreepress.com/2021/02/01/editorial-we-need-more-wellness-days-to-keep-students-motivated-and-mentally-healthy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=editorial-we-need-more-wellness-days-to-keep-students-motivated-and-mentally-healthyWill union staff that report to campus on a daily basis also be given two wellness days off?Your email address will not be published.

SASKATOON -- 
	Justine Abigail Yu was taken aback but sadly unsurprised when a complete stranger verbally assaulted her while she was sitting in a Toronto park.
	“She yelled out loud that ‘all Chinese people should go to jail,’” the Filipina woman recalled to CTV News.
	While she has firsthand experience being the victim of a racist attack, she has the tools to cope with it, and shares them with Asian Canadians who’ve been experiencing a mental toll from wall-to-wall news coverage of anti-Asian hate.
	Since last year, Yu, a Toronto-based magazine editor, has been running various writing workshops for people from racialized communities to share their varied experiences, which includes venting about racist attacks they’ve experienced, as well as the vicarious trauma they feel from others being targetted.
	And mental health experts told CTVNews.ca, journaling and venting can be therapeutic for many who feel their concerns are finally being taken seriously.
	“I think it’s important that when we finally vocalize those things that we are received in a safe way, especially since so many of these things have been internalized for so long,” Carmen Huang, a British-Columbia-based registered clinical counsellor, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.
	For years and in too many cases, she said racist experiences or microaggressions have been downplayed or dismissed. So it’s very welcome to see more and more people finding others to publically have their feelings and experiences validated.
	“If you are feeling angry, name it. If you are feeling sad, name that and do not feel you need to suppress that,” Huang said.
	Huang is also encouraged by more people online sharing how they’re not OK or seeking therapy, because it normalizes talking about the mental trauma from racism.
	Another mental health expert, Lin Fang, echoed that.
	“There is a community supporting me, where people not only have shared experiences but also shared interests where people want to do things together,” said Fang, associate professor of at the Factor-Inwentash Chair in Children’s Mental Health at the University of Toronto.
	Meanwhile, mental health experts are praising the Facebook group venting space in Quebec, “Groupe d’Entraide contre le racisme envers les asiatiques au Québec,” for being a sounding board for people.
	“It’s helpful but it also brings hope in a time like this,” Fang said, adding that she too felt there was a collective relief of not needing to justify their feelings regarding anti-Asian racism.
	But the concept of vicarious trauma is not lost on for other racialized groups, particularly Black people fighting against police brutality and anti-Black racism.
	“We know that trauma leads to forms of despair, hopelessness, nihilism, aspects of depression, anxiousness, your palms are sweating,” Chad Dion Lassiter, a licensed clinical social worker, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview.
	He said even people like him, who work to tackle racial injustice, need to take breaks too.
	Lassiter strongly urged racialized people, especially Asian people now who may be struggling, to consider going to therapy, either through social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, or even talking to trained people of faith.
	Doing so can equip them with the language to articulate what they’re feeling and learn mental health tips when they’re triggered, said Lassiter, the co-founder of Black Men at Penn School of Social Work, Inc. at the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice.
	He also urged people to turn to journaling, meditating or praying, instead of slipping into bad habits such as oversleeping or self-medicating.
	Fang agreed, saying some may feel guilty taking time for themselves, but that the guilt isn’t warranted.
	“It’s okay, we don’t have to be combating it all the time, we need to take care of ourselves first and when we have the energy, then we can re-join,” she said. “Having some self-care is always helpful to maintain that wellness and well-being.”
	Huang said people should do things which recharge them, like reading, turning to art, singing, enjoying a walk or simply writing down your feelings.
	Lassiter also encouraged people from non-Asian groups to check in on their Asian friends and colleagues and ask what they need.
	“The moment that we find ourselves in is that we’re interwoven, we should be supporting one another because of the fundamental basis of who we are that we’re all human,” he said, noting support between racialized groups has to be reciprocal and ongoing – something he’s seen happening lately in many younger generations of Black and Asian people.Stock photo of an man looking out a window.

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Last updated at 12:25 a.m. ESTBefore announcing Billie Eilish as the 2021 Grammy winner for Record of the Year, Ringo Starr said, “If you’re making music in our world today, you’ve already won.” It was the perfect sentiment to sum up the 63rd Grammy Awards, which honored musicians in an unprecedented fashion during the primetime show, held live from an outdoor stage outside of the Staples Center arena in Los Angeles with Covid-19 precautions. Most of the winners were announced ahead of the show during the livestreamed Premiere Ceremony, leaving plenty of time for 20 performances from artists including Doja Cat, DaBaby, Taylor Swift, Roddy Ricch, Bruno Mars and more. It was a night full of firsts—but women ruled. All four of the main categories were won by women: Billie Eilish for the aforementioned, Taylor Swift for Album of the Year, H.E.R. for Song of the Year and Megan Thee Stallion for Best New Artist. Beyoncé became the most decorated female artist in Grammy history after winning Best R&B Performance for “Black Parade,” Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for her feature on the “Savage” remix, and Best Music Video for “Brown Skin Girl,” which brought her grand total to 28 awards. In an acceptance speech, she praised her 9-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter, who became the second youngest Grammy winner ever for her writing credit on “Brown Skin Girl.” The Carters were in stellar company as women claimed the night’s biggest moments: Megan Thee Stallion was the first female rapper to earn Best New Artist since Lauryn Hill’s win 22 years ago; Mickey Guyton became the first Black female country artist to perform at the Grammy Awards with her breathtaking rendition of “Black Like Me”; Taylor Swift became the first woman to win Album of the Year three times after Folklore took home the 2021 title. Other than Megan Thee Stallion, first-time Grammy winners included One Direction alum Harry Styles for Best Pop Solo Performance, Kaytranada for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album, and perhaps most noteworthy, Nas—after 14 nominations since 1997—for Best Rap Album.

https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/3/23/22345407/what-did-david-dobrik-do-vlog-squad-cancelled-youtube,"Something is extremely wrong with the way vloggers perpetuate the idea of consent. 

If you asked an average teenager who their favorite influencer was at any point over the past few years, there’s a pretty high likelihood they’d say it was David Dobrik. Dobrik, 24, is a YouTuber with 18 million subscribers, best known for his slice-of-life vlogs where he parties with his fellow quasi-famous friends and pulls pranks with celebrities, resulting in videos with bait-y, all-caps titles like “CAN’T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED (EMOTIONAL)” (as far as I know this is not an actual title, but it could be). It’s not difficult to pinpoint what made him so beloved: Dobrik plays the role of the approachable guy who’s buddies with all the popular kids but still seems like a good person, the Nick Carraway of the Gen Z influencer world. Each week we’ll send you the very best from The Goods, plus a special TikTok edition by Rebecca Jennings on Tuesdays. Sign up here.That is, until you start rewatching some of Dobrik’s videos. After a while, his “Vlog Squad” could look less like an organic group of friends and more like a cast of characters suffering from severe Stockholm Syndrome; the “pranks” Dobrik and his crew pull start seeming more like exercises in stretching the limits of consent. And over the past year or so, he’s faced far more serious allegations than general YouTube-style tastelessness. Last June, YouTuber Seth Francois spoke about the racist situations he was forced into as the only Black member of the Vlog Squad, from being the butt of jokes about watermelon to blackface. Then in February, he discussed the time that he was “pranked” into making out with a man he didn’t consent to; he says he now considers it sexual assault. Also in February, former Vlog Squad member Nick Keswani revealed on a podcast how he was continually mocked for his dwarfism and treated like “a punching bag” during his time with the group. The most damning allegation yet came last week, when Insider published a story of a woman who says she was raped by Vlog Squad member Dom Zeglaitis, a.k.a. “Durte Dom,” during a video shoot. In 2018, college student “Hannah” (a pseudonym) went with a group of friends to an apartment to film a video with the crew, and what unfolded was an all-too-familiar scene: Hannah, who was 20 at the time, says that she became so incapacitated with alcohol supplied by Vlog Squad members that she could not consent to sex. She and a friend went into a room with Zeglaitis, where he allegedly had sex with her while other members of the Vlog Squad listened outside. The resulting video — entitled “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!!” and portrayed as a threesome plot — was deleted after Hannah objected to it, but not before it reached 5 million views. Hannah describes feeling like she had to play a part for the sake of the Vlog Squad’s content. “It was very much an environment where it felt like saying ‘no’ was not OK,” she told Insider. “It felt like from the moment we came there was an expectation that they were doing us a favor and we had to give them content. They were verbally, like, ‘Why aren’t you guys being fun? Do something sort of sexy.’”It’s not the first time the Vlog Squad has been described this way. Francois, the Black former member, said in a podcast that he was always fearful of being seen as a curmudgeon if he wasn’t willing to be game for a video. “It was an unwritten thing where you see a pattern of people saying, ‘Yo, I’m uncomfortable with this,’” he said. “All of a sudden they disappear and they’re not in videos anymore.” The reason it sounds familiar is because it’s applicable to nearly every toxic workplace in any industry: The risk of potential exclusion is made out to be worth the price of staying silent. But there’s something unique to YouTube culture, where the idea of consent is inherently blurry. I’m reminded of the recent conversation I had with former Vlog Squad member Trisha Paytas, where she told me about how she’d been in a relationship with fellow member Jason Nash on and off for about two years, but the terms of the relationship were never defined. Instead, she was publicly referred to as his girlfriend in videos but was never quite sure how much weight the term actually held. It’s a common arrangement for vloggers who make content about their lives, but who embellish (or shield) certain aspects for the sake of building a consumable narrative. Ultimately, Paytas says she was pushed out of the group and her relationship when she was no longer useful for the squad. All of this gets lost on camera, though. “It seemed like I had a super-fun night with these famous vloggers, basically, which is not what happened,” Hannah said of the video she ended up in. “Every single person that I know is messaging me, ‘You were in David Dobrik’s vlog, that’s so cool.’ Or ‘Oh my God, I saw the vlog you were in.’” I also think there’s a connection to an extremely popular couple’s recent announcement. Mike and Kat Stickler, a married couple who have 5.4 million followers on TikTok, tearfully announced their separation this week. To anyone who watched their lighthearted skits and Dobrik-esque vlogs (there was plenty of “pranking my wife!” content), the news came as a shock, yet in a deeper dive, the underlying tensions of the marriage could theoretically become visible: in their impressions of one another or their passive-aggressive sketches about married life. It’s impossible to deduce what led to the problems in their marriage (and it’s none of our business anyway), but when people’s normal lives are turned into consumable storytelling with clear narratives that allow for zero nuance, those around them can end up getting hurt. No one should feel like they have to play a role they never signed up for — especially not for someone else’s clout.This column first published in The Goods’ newsletter.
