# Keyword Extraction
For this project, I created a keyword extractor using the KeyBert Library. As a proof of concept, I used 5 news article links to extract keywords from.
The results of the keyword extraction are located in the 'keyword_extraction_poc.csv' file. 

## Dependencies 
All dependencies are included in the 'requirements1.txt' file 

### Extractor Building 
The web scraper and keyword extracting script is located in the 'keyword_extractor.py' file. The 'main.py' file runs the 'keyword_extractor.py' file and
generates the 'keyword_extraction_poc.csv' file.
