6064ca2cd537afb5c54759a5,2,keyachatterjee,So insecure & secure are the big umbrella terms. Within this insecure there's four descriptions for children but two primary ones for adults : Anxious  & Avoidant ,2021-03-31 19:14:52.264000
6064ca42d537afbdbc4759a6,8,selina,ohhh i see that makes a lot of sense actually,2021-03-31 19:15:14.148000
6064ca77d537af7e894759a7,2,keyachatterjee,Yep! Your attachment system is directly connected to your nervous system & sense of safety/ belonging in the world ,2021-03-31 19:16:07.384000
6064ca87d537af79554759a8,8,selina,right and it's developed in early childhood?,2021-03-31 19:16:23.733000
6064ca97d537af45474759a9,2,keyachatterjee,"Yes, around 6 months of age is when children start developing their attachment systems ",2021-03-31 19:16:39.819000
6064cac8d537af117e4759aa,8,selina,"im just realizing this is rlly important for all of us in how we deal w platonic, work, and romatic relationships",2021-03-31 19:17:28.214000
6064cad8d537af77e54759ab,2,keyachatterjee,yep!! ,2021-03-31 19:17:44.238000
6064caf6d537af1d464759ac,8,selina,is it also true that u tend to seek familiar attachment styles that you have w your parents when looking for a partner,2021-03-31 19:18:14.188000
6064cafed537af6d234759ad,2,keyachatterjee,"Like I have a super secure attachment with my friends, and I am anxiously attached in relationships. However, I am currently dating someone with a secure attachment style, which has influenced me and I have noticed I am now more secure than anxious ",2021-03-31 19:18:22.883000
6064cb24d537af01fa4759ae,8,selina,ohh i see so your styles can be influenced by the person you're with,2021-03-31 19:19:00.113000
6064cb2bd537af29cb4759af,8,selina,as in they can make you more secure/insecure,2021-03-31 19:19:07.090000
6064cb96d537af38a74759b0,2,keyachatterjee,"It is true, not necessarily because of what we know as Freud's thing about mothers & fathers etc. ",2021-03-31 19:20:54.519000
6064cbb6d537af924c4759b1,2,keyachatterjee,"But because your relationship with parents/ family are your primary attachment experiences, and therefore is what your body/ brain then believe to be ""normal"" ",2021-03-31 19:21:26.217000
6064cbd0d537af01184759b2,8,selina,right thats another thing to consider,2021-03-31 19:21:52.968000
6064cbe2d537af30594759b3,8,selina,oh i'd think Freud's theory would be applicable to this?,2021-03-31 19:22:10.539000
6064cbe5d537af58e34759b4,2,keyachatterjee,"So, say you have an insecure attachment with your mom and you don't always feel safe around her and so you don't have a sense of stability within that relationship. As you get older, you might begin to associate that with how relationships should be",2021-03-31 19:22:13.650000
6064cc11d537af0c074759b5,8,selina,mhm that makes a lot sense,2021-03-31 19:22:57.954000
6064cc1fd537af68ee4759b6,2,keyachatterjee,"His theory is absurd haha but it does touch on the fact that your relationship with your parents serves as a model for later relationships. But it's not set in stone, because once you're more aware of it you can choose to do things differently",2021-03-31 19:23:11.276000
6064cc28d537af71f14759b7,8,selina,and so as your attachment style with your mom evolves what you seek out also changes?,2021-03-31 19:23:20.344000
6064cc45d537af0d154759b8,8,selina,right Freuds def a little coocoo,2021-03-31 19:23:49.434000

6064cc59d537af9aa54759ba,8,selina,but it's interesting how he was thinking abt this sorta thing so long ago,2021-03-31 19:24:09.114000
6064cc71d537af47a94759bb,2,keyachatterjee,I know! he was definitely getting at something ,2021-03-31 19:24:33.390000
6064cc7fd537af09e54759bc,2,keyachatterjee,but then just went about theorizing instead of testing lol ,2021-03-31 19:24:47.400000
6064cca3d537af0a594759bd,8,selina,hahah yup he was not into empiricism,2021-03-31 19:25:23.089000
6064ccb5d537af64b94759be,8,selina,ok so if you wanna change your attachemnt style u would need to actively work on it?,2021-03-31 19:25:41.884000
6064ccbfd537af6d7a4759bf,2,keyachatterjee,Yes,2021-03-31 19:25:51.535000
6064ccf0d537afec014759c0,2,keyachatterjee,"If you want to have a more secure relationship with a person, that involves some amount of work in that you need to understand what makes you feel safe, what your triggers are, learning methods to remind yourself that you are safe despite other people's actions etc. ",2021-03-31 19:26:40.153000
6064cd21d537af33fb4759c1,8,selina,right and that comes with a lot of reflection on both parts and communication,2021-03-31 19:27:29.288000
6064cd33d537af73f94759c2,2,keyachatterjee,"So I'll give you a big example of what I am saying. I have an anxious attachment system. This means, when my system is activated I tend to behave in behaviors that are considered to be ""reassurance seeking"" and to re-establish connection/ intimacy/ sense of security",2021-03-31 19:27:47.398000
6064cd5fd537afda394759c3,2,keyachatterjee,The first step to working on your attachment system is being able to recognize when you're feeling activated,2021-03-31 19:28:31.416000
6064cd6fd537af31e84759c4,2,keyachatterjee,Ugh I wish I could show you a diagram from the text ,2021-03-31 19:28:47.401000
6064cd7dd537af81e74759c5,2,keyachatterjee,it does such a good job of showing stages of activation and what it leads to in different attachment styles,2021-03-31 19:29:01.737000
6064cd7fd537af2c6e4759c6,8,selina,by activated do u mean triggered/feeling insecure in your relationship?,2021-03-31 19:29:03.723000

6064ce30d537af1e6f4759c9,8,selina,im looking at the diagram it rlly intersting - like when your partner responds negatively to you seeking closeness it goes back into u feeling anxious and becomes a cycle ,2021-03-31 19:32:00.225000
6064ce3cd537af5b164759ca,2,keyachatterjee,Yes ,2021-03-31 19:32:12.776000

6064cedbd537afbba34759d1,2,keyachatterjee,"Exactly! You first have to identify what you need to feel safe and secure, and then you have to directly ask that of your partner. If they're unable or unwilling, that would be a red-flag. ",2021-03-31 19:34:51.852000
6064ceecd537af6c2c4759d2,2,keyachatterjee,Seriously!! My children are gonna be so sick of psychology and self improvement etc. ,2021-03-31 19:35:08.841000

6064cfd2d537afcfda4759d9,2,keyachatterjee,It goes into co-dependency too ,2021-03-31 19:38:58.683000
6064cff9d537af9b284759da,8,selina,that feels quite assuring to hear for some reason,2021-03-31 19:39:37.534000
6064d00ed537af07144759db,8,selina,co dependency is mutual dependence/depending on each other?,2021-03-31 19:39:58.214000

6064d060d537af6a564759e1,2,keyachatterjee,right!!!! ,2021-03-31 19:41:20.921000
6064d071d537afaa744759e2,2,keyachatterjee,"I will say, I do think self-soothing is importnat",2021-03-31 19:41:37.342000
6064d076d537af779d4759e3,2,keyachatterjee,and you cannot get everything from another person ,2021-03-31 19:41:42.349000
6064d082d537afefee4759e4,8,selina,oh for sure!!,2021-03-31 19:41:54.942000
6064d088d537af0d464759e5,2,keyachatterjee,"BUT, to beat yourself up about needing reassurance and depending on a person you're close to... no bueno",2021-03-31 19:42:00.213000
6064d097d537afb79c4759e6,2,keyachatterjee,I think that's one thing that in the book they could re-iterate ,2021-03-31 19:42:15.117000
6064d0b6d537af13f54759e7,8,selina,right! so we have be good at determining where the line is,2021-03-31 19:42:46.188000
6064d0bdd537af5acc4759e8,2,keyachatterjee,exactly ,2021-03-31 19:42:53.274000
6064d0e2d537af42bf4759e9,8,selina,being independent and self-loving and fulfilling while feeling comfortable enough to seek the reassurance u need from your partner,2021-03-31 19:43:30.204000
6064d117d537af11994759ea,8,selina,and i guess there r healthy/unhealthy forms of reassurance a partner can give u?,2021-03-31 19:44:23.753000
6064d11bd537af42b84759eb,2,keyachatterjee,Just to clarify you're saying that you want to feel comfortable/ safe enough to communicate and ask for what you need? ,2021-03-31 19:44:27.829000
6064d11ed537af5cd34759ec,2,keyachatterjee,oh my gosh yes ,2021-03-31 19:44:30.626000
6064d12ed537af713b4759ed,2,keyachatterjee,The chapter called: The anxious-avoidant trap,2021-03-31 19:44:46.520000
6064d134d537af31e34759ee,8,selina,yes in the right moderation and without feeing guilt,2021-03-31 19:44:52.533000
6064d140d537afa59b4759ef,8,selina,ooooo,2021-03-31 19:45:04.346000
6064d169d537af11ac4759f0,2,keyachatterjee,"Exactly. It's more about acknowledging that its just human nature to need security. And in relationships, security is measured in intimacy and feelings of connectedness",2021-03-31 19:45:45.062000
6064d195d537aff2dc4759f1,2,keyachatterjee,"So it's not that your partner is responsible for all your needs, but both partners are responsible for the connectedness and intimacy in the relationship",2021-03-31 19:46:29.741000
6064d1b1d537af14314759f2,8,selina,right so u shouldn't feel guilty about needing security as long as your partner is not the only source of security for u,2021-03-31 19:46:57.814000
6064d1b9d537af65464759f3,2,keyachatterjee,So it's important to identify what makes you feel close to your partner (insert love languages) ,2021-03-31 19:47:05.590000
6064d1bdd537af69524759f4,2,keyachatterjee,Exactly!! ,2021-03-31 19:47:09.672000
6064d1ccd537af60fe4759f5,8,selina,i waas just thinking love languages!,2021-03-31 19:47:24.245000
6064d1e1d537afb2144759f6,2,keyachatterjee,That could be a whole other discussion! ,2021-03-31 19:47:45.297000
6064d1f9d537af08774759f7,8,selina,but yes that's a great point connectedness and intimacy is definitely a 2-way street whereas security can be self-supplied,2021-03-31 19:48:09.046000
6064d205d537afd0644759f8,8,selina,haha yeah let's have that convo another time!,2021-03-31 19:48:21.399000

6064d271d537af57614759fb,2,keyachatterjee,Exactly! And by advocating what you need in a relationship to feel secure/ connected etc. is a way to self-supply your security ,2021-03-31 19:50:09.354000
6064d28dd537af84d94759fc,8,selina,this is so interesting i need to do more reading on my own,2021-03-31 19:50:37.527000
6064d28ed537af7eb74759fd,2,keyachatterjee,"Because then you can recognize that you're in a situation that is good for you and your needs. Or you're not. And if it's not and the other person doesn't seem willing to do something about it, then they're truly not the right person",2021-03-31 19:50:38.730000
6064d2c7d537af221a4759fe,8,selina,"exactly!! it's all about being on the same page, or at least willing to put in the effort to undertand the other",2021-03-31 19:51:35.727000
6064d2d2d537af10784759ff,2,keyachatterjee,Exactly!!! ,2021-03-31 19:51:46.507000
