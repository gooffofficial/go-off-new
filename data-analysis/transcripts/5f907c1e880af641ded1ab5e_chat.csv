Some of the most intelligent and capable leaders in our country sit in the middle of our political spectrum. That's the type of leader I believe we need. One who can compromise, listen, and make progress. One who doesn't have an underlying agenda to turn our people against each other and divide us into rigid categories. Our system encourages people to choose the left or right, ultimately making the moderate voter/poltician powerless ",2020-10-23 02:09:38.046000
